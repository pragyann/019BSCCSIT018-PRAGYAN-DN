# Request-Response Interaction Script

This script simulates a basic client-server interaction using Python sockets. It includes two main components: a server script and a client script.

## Server Script

The server script (`server.py`) performs the following tasks:

- Listens for incoming connections from clients.
- Receives requests from clients.
- Processes the requests.
- Generates appropriate responses based on the requests.
- Sends responses back to the clients.

## Client Script

The client script (`client.py`) performs the following tasks:

- Connects to the server.
- Sends requests to the server specifying the desired service or resource.
- Receives and displays responses from the server.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script files (`server.py`, `client.py`, and `request_response_interaction.bat`).
4. Run the batch file to execute both the server and client scripts by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   request_response_interaction.bat
   ```
5. Follow the prompts in the client window to enter requests and view responses.
